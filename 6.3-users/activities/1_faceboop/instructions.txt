As before, do one challenge at a time, and raise your hand if/when you
get stuck!


-------------------
Challenge 1:

Get this code running. You should see a site that might coincidentally
resemble a popular social network when it is fully working. Refer to the
steps from previous activities if you get stuck.

Generally, it requires three steps:
pipenv --python 3.6
pipenv shell
pipenv install django

Then finally:
python manage.py runserver

Click around a little, until you understand the app. Note that the
posting and search functionalities are (intentionally) broken.




-------------------
Challenge 2:

Discuss with a student next to you the following aspects of the Django
project:

0. "faceboop" vs "wall", which is the Django project, which is the
Django app?

1. Examine faceboop/urls.py. Note the "name=" parameter. Now, examine
the "wall/templates/base.html", see the code {% url "home" %} and {% url
"feed" %}. Can you guess what it might be doing?

2. Can you figure out how the different navbar items highlight
conditionally based on what link you click on?



-------------------
Challenge 3:

Note how the form to post share new content to the Faceboop feed isn't
fully working. It's missing some code in the feed view (found in
views.py). Fix it so that it shows the new data.


-------------------
Challenge 4:

Take a look at the NewUserForm. Flesh it out to include the following
fields:
* name
* date joined
* email

Hint: You might need to use an EmailField for email, and a DateField for
date joined. Look at previous exercises for examples of both!


-------------------
Challenge 5:

Now, use this form you just created to allow new users to be added to the
homepage.



-------------------
Bonus Challenge:

Presently, the "search" view is only a stub (that is to say, the
definition exists, but has no code).  Implement the search box
functionality. Create a new "search" template.  Write the necessary
functionality to only return posts that contain the search term entered.

* For full functionality, make it be case insensitive, and tolerate
  certain punctuation differences

* To DRY out your template, add a template snippet and using include in
  both feed.html and search.html to include it
