As before, do one challenge at a time, and raise your hand if/when you
get stuck!


-------------------
Challenge 1: Installing Django-Bootstrap4

Get this code running, same as before. Then, do the following to install
this 3rd party package:

pipenv install django-bootstrap4

Add to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py:

'bootstrap4',


Make sure stuff still runs without error.



-------------------
Challenge 2: Using Django-Bootstrap4

Start with one template, such as the Sitter application template, and
convert it to using the bootstrap4 forms package to render your forms.

Below is the example code that is given to you by the documentation for
django-bootstrap4.  Utilize this documentation to upgrade your forms to use
this package:

{% load bootstrap4 %}

<form action="" method="POST" class="form">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {% bootstrap_form form %}
    {% buttons %}
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
    {% endbuttons %}
</form>


-------------------
Challenge 3
Do the same as Challenge 2, except for your dog form.



-------------------
Bonus Challenges:
Spend you remaining time researching more packages from Django Packages. Can
you enhance this page even further? Here are a few examples:

1. Add in phone number or address validation
2. Try to get "django debug toolbar" functioning (this is a cool thing we'll
look at again later!)
