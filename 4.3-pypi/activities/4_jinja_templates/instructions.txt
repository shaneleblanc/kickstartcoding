1. First, create a new pipenv environment here:
pipenv --python 3.6

2. Install the necessary dependencies (presently, just Jinja2):
pipenv shell
pipenv install

3. Now, run the script. Make sure it generates an output.html. Open the
output.html file. It's lacking a lot!

4. Examine (without modification) the build.py file, and the
"wonderland.json" file. Can you understand what you are looking at?

5. Follow these challenges to complete challenge. None of these
challenges will require modifying the Python source code or the JSON
file.


Challenge 1:
Change the template to include the book's author and title, correctly
formatted, by including context variables with the {{ }} syntax. The
title is already included, but is formatted poorly. You'll have to use
the {{ book_title|title }} syntax to transform the title into the right
case.


Challenge 2:
Add the chapter count above the table of contents.


Challenge 3:
Generate the table of contents. It should list each chapter name


Challenge 4:
Generate chapter headers underneath the table of contents for each
chapter.


Challenge 5:
Generate paragraphs for each chapter, fully formatting the book.


Bonus 1: Add a horizontal rule between all chapters. Hint: You will need
to use "loop.last"

Bonus 2: Make the first paragraph of each chapter be a "blockquote"
instead of a p tag. Hint: You will need to use "loop.first"

Bonus 3: Make it so that when you click on the table of contents links,
it will go to that chapter.

Advanced Bonus: Practice creating Jinja2 custom "filters". Make one that
gets word count. Include the word count of each chapter after each ToC
item. (This is the only one that will require modification of the Python
sourcecode)

Advanced Bonus: Still have time? Practice your CSS styling on this book.
Can you improve on the this sakura theme?
