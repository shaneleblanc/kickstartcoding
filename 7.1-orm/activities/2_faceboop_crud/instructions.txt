As before, do one challenge at a time, and raise your hand if/when you
get stuck!


-------------------
Challenge 1:

Get this code running. You should see a site that might coincidentally
resemble a popular social network when it is fully working. Refer to the
steps from previous activities if you get stuck.

Generally, it requires three steps:
pipenv --python 3.6
pipenv shell
pipenv install django

Then finally:
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

Click around a little, until you understand the app. Note that the
posting and search functionalities are (intentionally) broken.




-------------------
Challenge 2:

Your goal now is to implement C aspect of CRUD. Look at the views.py for
further clues.


-------------------
Challenge 3:

Implement R aspect of CRUD. Look at the views.py for further clues.


-------------------
Challenge 4:

Implement D aspect of CRUD. Look at the views.py for further clues.


-------------------
Challenge 5:

Implement U aspect of CRUD. Look at the views.py for further clues.


-------------------
Advanced Bonus Challenge:

Can you make it so that the user who is posting the wall post has a
username that appears in the post?
