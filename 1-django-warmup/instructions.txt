In this activity we want to warm up our Django skills and make a simple
website.

----

Challenge 1:
Get the code working!
1. Run "pipenv shell" to enable pipenv
2. Run "pipenv install" to install dependencies from Pipfile (in this
case, only Django)
3. Run python manage.py runserver to run the Django Python server itself

Now, visit localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000 (both will do the same
thing).

----

Challenge 2:
Your goal now is to create another page that is linked to from the home
page, just as there is the about_me page.

Modify the manage.py (but don't touch the boilerplate at the bottom!).

----

Challenge 3:
Look at the solution for the final activity from last class. Can you
incorporate Django templating? Create a "chat room" where you can enter
a username and a message.
