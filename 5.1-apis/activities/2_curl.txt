1. Use curl -v to a GET request to google.com:
    curl -v google.com

2. Try using curl on other sites, compare and contrast the results.
Discuss with the person next to you, see if you can formulate in your
own words what is going on, what is being sent as a request, and what is
getting received as response.

3. Now, as before, open up a site using Google Dev tools, and go to the
networking tab. Browse around some, and, as before, see the "requests"
pop up. Right click on one of the requests and select "Copy" and
then select "Copy as cURL command" (or something similar).

4. The curl commands that Google Chrome generates are monstrous. Paste
it in, and then discuss with your partner what you think it does.

5. Add a '-v' at the end before you run it to see EVEN MORE information
about what it is doing. It will be A LOT of info, so see if you can
read through the gibberish and find relevant information within the
code.


Bonus Challenge:
Take a look at: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis

Can you get any of those APIs working using cURL?
